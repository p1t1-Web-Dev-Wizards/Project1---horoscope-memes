# Project1---horoscope-memes

URL: https://p1t1-web-dev-wizards.github.io/Project1---horoscope-memes/

## Summary:

The goal of this project was to start your day off right by delivering your daily horoscope and a joke or random meme. We worked to display a daily horoscope and mood and then a joke or meme related to your daily mood. 

We then added the ability to save a favorite combination of your horoscope/mood and returned gif to create a list of favorite combos for later viewing.

We encountered some challenges with styling the materialize content for best readability and navigation. 

Integrating a branding scheme of logo, name, color combos, and astrology themes was a fun part of the project.


## Technology utilized:

- Materialize
- Google fonts
- moment.js
- GIPHY API for gif/meme content
- aztro API for astrology/horoscope content
